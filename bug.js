This React Native bug is related to using AsyncStorage with large data. When attempting to store a large JSON object (approximately 1MB) using AsyncStorage.setItem, the app crashes on Android, while iOS works fine.  The error message on Android is vague and doesn't pinpoint the exact cause, often indicating an out of memory error or JSON.stringify issues, although the memory usage doesn't appear excessively high.
